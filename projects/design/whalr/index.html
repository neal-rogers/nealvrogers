		 		<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>
					Most Reddit apps display content similar to the site’s own bulletin board style layout without adding to the experience of browsing Reddit. This minimalist, feed-based approach is effective at presenting user-generated content in high volume but misses an opportunity to keep users engaged with multimedia posts. Especially for users providing their own original multimedia content, the submission process needed to be simple and intuitive.

					Whal/r/ had a mandate - stay true to the spirit of Reddit while building a rich, intuitive, visual experience. Carrying that mandate into the design users are never more than one tap away from their favorite subreddits.
