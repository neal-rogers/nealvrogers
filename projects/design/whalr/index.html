  		<h1>Whal/r/</h1>
  			<h2>An app redesign project.</h2>
  			<div class="inner-container" id="project">
  		 		<h2>The Problem</h2>
  				<p>
            In my experience, few apps have done little more than display content as an endless text-based list, restricting users to a single subreddit. This approach, while great for skimming over a high volume of similar content, isn’t particularly engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baconreader became the focus of my redesign project for this very reason. Also, admittedly, due in some part to my own familiarity with and affinity for the app.
          </p>
          <h2>The Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            As a rookie UX designer, I developed design principles and followed a workflow in accordance with Jake Knapp’s, <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" >Sprint, How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</a>. Just for fun I opted to rename and rebrand the app Whal/r/, in honor of Reddit’s collective love for the noble and majestic narwhal.
          </p>
            <h3>Mapping Processes & Goals (Monday)</h3>
          <p>
            My goal for the first day was to target a problem that I could solve by the end of the week. So, based on my own expectations of Reddit users, I tried to build a (very) rough process map.
          </p>
    			<img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-monday.jpg">
          <p>
            By the end of day one I had set my sights on building a simple solution for post submission and commenting. I also established a set of guiding principles to inform the designs I would create later. I decided the app needed to prioritize key options and functions while adhering to a consistent, minimalist design.
          </p>
          <h3>Sketching (Tuesday)</h3>
          <p>
            Tuesday started with a thorough review of Baconreader and ended with some unique solutions for Whal/r/. To start, I sketched screens that captured aspects of my competitor's functionality.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-tuesday-1.jpg"> 
          <p>
            It wasn’t long into my review that I found some room for improvement. Specifically, I discovered that Baconreader hampered browsing with its limited navigational tools and relegated the sharing function to drop-down menus. It became clear to me I could capitalize on those shortcomings and that I would need to consider them as I drew plans for my prototype.
          </p>
          <h4>Initial Sketches</h4>
          <p>
            My sketches helped me to develop ideas my target flows as well as plot the overall behavior of the app itself.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-tuesday-2.jpg">
          <img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-tuesday-4.jpg">
          <h4>Crazy 8's</h4>
          <p>
            The rather intense, one-minute ideation sessions were somewhat helpful (if a bit nerve-racking). And though they were few, I managed to jot down ideas for user interaction, layout, etc.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-tuesday-3.jpg">
          <h3>Storyboarding (Wednesday)</h3>
          <p>
            Wednesday, I took the best sketches and rendered a storyboard. During this process I tried to conceive of a scenario wherein a user would discover Whal/r/, install it, and submit their own content to Reddit through the app.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-wednesday-1.jpg">
          <img src="img/whalr-sprint-sketches-wednesday-2.jpg">
          <p>
            A welcome result of this exercise was gaining some user perspective; an appreciation for what users might expect and how they would interact with my app.
          </p>
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            My main objective at this point was to firm up the concepts explored in my sketches and think about how I might best utilize them in my designs.
          </p>
          <h3>Prototyping (Thursday)</h3>
          <h4>Wireframes: First Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            The first set of wireframes I created were focused on the navigation and sharing issues I previously identified during the competitive analysis phase. One key characteristic of the early versions included the addition of subreddit names to the navbar and making them clickable (tap-able) navigation components.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-wireframe-2.jpg">
          <p>
            It was my hope that by doing so would I could make traversing subreddits a simpler task and, much <a href="https://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2006/11/breadcrumb-navigation.html" target="_blank">like location-based breadcrumbs</a>, increase the speed of browsing. I also moved the share button out of its menu and onto the navbar for easier access.
          </p>
          <h4>User Flow</h4>
          <p>
            Alongside my early wireframes I developed a diagram for my two main user flows. Akin to the storyboard exercise, this process helped me fill the gaps between design objectives and early wireframes.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-userflow.png">
          <h4>Wireframes: Second Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            It was my intention while creating the second set of wireframes to focus mainly on adding necessary post information, e.g., timestamp, votes, etc., that I’d left out. However, once I reviewed the user flow diagram I decided that I also need to eliminate a redundant screen in the prototype. In its place I added multi-function button for media and URL links.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-wireframe-4.jpg">
          <br>
          <h3>User Testing (Friday)</h3>
          <p>
            Five users were asked to complete several tasks using the second iteration of wireframes as a prototype. During testing, users were encouraged to elaborate on their interactions with the prototype as they attempted to complete each task.
          </p>
          <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
          <p>
            The graph below displays each task along with respective completion times for each of the participants. Based on the testing parameters, the typical 8 second completion time seemed an acceptable mean. 
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-usability-1.jpg">
          <p>
            Tests also revealed that submission and sort tasks took users between 18 and 24 seconds to complete. I found this especially interesting considering the only two recorded failures to complete were for those very same tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it came to post submission delays, I presumed the decision-making requirements and multi-part nature of the process made them justifiable. The sort function, however, seemed deeply flawed as users spent in excess of 20 seconds simply trying to locate the button.
          </p>
          <h4>Mock-Ups</h4>
          <p>
            Now that I had some quantifiable data to inform my design decisions I set to creating mock-ups. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In keeping with my wireframes, I wanted to build my design around cards as it seemed the simplest means to make content readily scannable. My decision to do so was bolstered by the fact that <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/" target="_blank">79 percent of users scan pages rather than read word-by-word</a>.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-home.jpg">
          <p>
            Further designs expanded upon the navbar and added distinct visual indicators for user interaction and location within the app.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-editpost.jpg">
          <img src="img/whalr-menu.jpg">
          <img src="img/whalr-post.jpg">
          <p>
            Of course, crucial functionality, like the share button, was also given a place directly on the post screen and pulled from the doldrums of a secondary menu.
          </p>
          <img src="img/whalr-comparison-share.jpg">
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            The next logical step for the Whal/r/ project is to conduct further rounds of testing with the finished mock-ups. Such tests would include thorough usability evaluations and A/B testing of visual components.
